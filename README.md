# Simple Linear Regression
- Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.
- Simple linear regression is a statistical approach that allows us to study and summarize the relationship between two continuous quantitative variables. 
- Out of the two variables, one variable is called the dependent variable, and the other variable is called the independent variable. 
- Our goal is to predict the dependent variableâ€™s value based on the value of the independent variable. 
- A simple linear regression aims to find the best relationship between X (independent variable) and Y (dependent variable).
