# Simple-Linear-Regression
- Simple linear regression is a statistical approach that allows us to study and summarize the relationship between two continuous quantitative variables. 
- Out of the two variables, one variable is called the dependent variable, and the other variable is called the independent variable. 
- Our goal is to predict the dependent variableâ€™s value based on the value of the independent variable. 
- A simple linear regression aims to find the best relationship between X (independent variable) and Y (dependent variable).
